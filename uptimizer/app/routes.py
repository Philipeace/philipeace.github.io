# This file is now effectively deprecated and replaced by the new blueprint files.
# It can be safely removed or kept empty. For clarity, let's leave it empty.

# All routes have been moved to individual blueprint files:
# - views.py (HTML rendering)
# - api_general.py
# - api_clients.py
# - api_endpoints.py
# - api_stats.py
# - api_config.py
#
# These blueprints are registered in main.py.
